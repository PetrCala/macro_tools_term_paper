I present the solution for this part in the form of a simple extension of the previous part. This is for two simple reasons:
-You can easily see and replicate all of the results, which all stem from the data obtained at the beginning. It thus makes no sense to
	publish just the code for this part, as the results would not be replicable at all without all of the necessary parts.
-We are being given continuous feedback on the procedure, so I belive there is very little incentive to start writing the term paper early.
	The structure is the easiest to modify when I work with the .ipynb file directly. Furthermore, it is very likely the results and
	reasoning are both subject to change, and writing a research paper before the results and concrete just seems silly. Plus it is additional,
	unnecessary work. I hope this approach to the task is understandable, and I am looking forward to receiving the feedback on this part.
